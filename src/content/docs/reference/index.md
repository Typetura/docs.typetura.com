title: Typetura Reference
---

To style using Typetura there are three main areas that would be helpful to understand: [containers](#containers), [Typetura elements](#typetura-elements), and [styles](#styles).

## [Containers](/reference/containers)

By default, the container is the viewport, but you can define containers that Typetura uses to observe width changes by using CSS Container queries. You have the choice to decide what element you want to be responsive to.

## [Typetura elements](/reference/elements)

Typetura uses a cocktail of animation styles to make everything work. Youâ€™ll need to apply these styles by either using the utility classes or by modifying the selector list.

## [Styles](/reference/styles)

Typetura styles are managed with CSS Keyframes along with a few animation properties. Learn more about what they are and how to use them.

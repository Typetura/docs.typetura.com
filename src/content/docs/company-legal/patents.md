Use of this software does not grant license to any patents held by Typetura LLC. For more information, please contact [Typetura LLC](https://typetura.com/patents/) at [info@typetura.com](mailto:info@typetura.com). These patents describe the distribution of typographic systems at scale as well as how design software might be used to create and manage dynamic typographic systems. These patents protect our business use cases and does not restrict the use of the software itself on projects you own, operate, control, or are a part of.

Our patents do not mention, explicitly refer to, or restrict the use of Typetura.css. Our patents describe products and product functionality that is important to our business. You can use Typetura.css and not infringe on our patents just as you could use clamp() to infringe on our patents.

As an example, if `fonts.bigcompany.com` is interested in distributing fluid typographic systems to unknown layouts with their fonts, they would need to license our patents. If `Big Design Software` decided to create an interface keyframing out text scaling in their app, they would need to license our patents. If `yourcompany.com` is using Typetura.css to style their website or is distributing a typographic system intended for use in a design system with templated layouts then they would not need to license the patents.
